        <p>
            I'm passionate about science, technology and the way in which we can use them to solve society's
            most pressing problems. I'm creative, naturally curious and I have excellent problem-solving skills.
            I enjoy learning about different things, and I have the aspiration of becoming a polymath.
            My main abilities are in everything tech, but I'm interested in economy, history, literature, and
            evolutionary biology.</p>
